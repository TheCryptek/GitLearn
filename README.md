# Purpose

When I first got into developing, I didn't really know where to host my code for others to help me with it other then google drive...That alone was a hassle and a pain, so I went looking for a solution and found GitHub. As you all know, to use GitHub you have to learn how to use git.. A tool that can be complicated if you don't even know where to start. This repository will allow me and others to teach those seeking to use git, how to use git.
